# Classify-images-of-clothing
This is one of my practice to understand neuronal networking, using the dataset of Keras MNIST-Fashion, which aim is classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts. Additionally, I use data of validation and regularities with the aim of reducing overfitting. I will be very glad about your feedback
